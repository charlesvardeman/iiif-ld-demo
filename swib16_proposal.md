# IIIF: Linked-Data to Support the Presentation and Reuse of Image Resources

Simeon Warner (Cornell University, United States of America)

## Abstract

The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) defines simple APIs and data formats to give scholars uniform and rich access to image-based resources hosted around the world. The community aims to develop, cultivate and document shared technologies, including image servers and web clients that provide a world-class user experience in viewing, comparing, manipulating and annotating images. While the framework supports use by non-semantic clients using JSON, all data models and formats are based on linked data. The IIIF thus provides both a rich environment for semantically aware clients, and an opportunity for support within larger linked-data systems. We believe that the rigor of developing within the framework of linked-data has helped in the development of clean semantics and provides a solid foundation for future work and extension. This workshop will briefly introduce the IIIF Image API, for image access and manipulation, and survey current client application. It will then focus on the IIIF Presentation API and the detailed description how resources are organized, related and presented. Participants will have the opportunity to work through some hands-on examples of manipulation of IIIF presentation information, using JSON-LD and linked-data tools, in order to support different interaction and viewing experiences. Audience: developers, systems librarians, those interested in image provision and presentation. Expertise: Participants should be familiar with the basics of linked data and RDF. In order to work through some hands-on examples then you'll need the ability to edit and run simple (Python) programs. Participants not wanting to do this directly could pair with others to work through examples together. Required equipment to work through examples: Laptop with the ability to run Python (2.7 or 3.x) and internet access to download code and modules. I can provide assistance with setup on Linux/OSX but not on Windows machines. (If you would be able and willing to help others in the workshop using Windows then please let me know.)
