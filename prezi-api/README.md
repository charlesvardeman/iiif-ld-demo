# IIIF Presentation API

> _"... describes how the structure and layout of a complex image-based object can be made available in a standard manner. Many different styles of viewer can be implemented that consume the information to enable a rich and dynamic experience, consuming content from across collections and hosting institutions._
>
> _An object may comprise a series of pages, surfaces or other views; for example the single view of a painting, the two sides of a photograph, four cardinal views of a statue, or the many pages of an edition of a newspaper or book. The primary requirements for the Presentation API are to provide an order for these views, the resources needed to display a representation of the view, and the descriptive information needed to allow the user to understand what is being seen."_ \[[IIIF Presentation API, Introduction](http://iiif.io/api/presentation/#introduction)]

> _"The objective ... is to provide the information necessary to allow a rich, online viewing environment for primarily image-based objects to be presented to a human user, likely in conjunction with the IIIF Image API. This is the sole purpose of the API and therefore the descriptive information is given in a way that is intended for humans to read, but not semantically available to machines. In particular, it explicitly does **not** aim to provide metadata that would drive discovery of the digitized objects."_ \[[IIIF Presentation API, Objectives and Scope](http://iiif.io/api/presentation/#objectives-and-scope)]
