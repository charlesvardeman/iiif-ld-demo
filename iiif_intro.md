# IIIF Introduction

**IIIF = International Image Interoperability Framework**

> The IIIF defines simple APIs and data formats to give scholars uniform and rich access to image-based resources hosted around the world. The community aims to develop, cultivate and document shared technologies, including image servers and web clients that provide a world-class user experience in viewing, comparing, manipulating and annotating images.

  * Slides: **[Introduction to IIIF](http://www.slideshare.net/azaroth42/introduction-to-iiif)**
  * The [IIIF Image API](http://iiif.io/api/image) supports rich access to _image_ resources -- the 'bits'.
  * The [IIIF Presentation API](http://iiif.io/api/presentation) provides the information necessary for clients to present image-based resource to users in rich, online viewing environments.
  * Supporting specifications deal with [authentication](http://iiif.io/api/auth) and [search within resources](http://iiif.io/api/search).
  * Work is underway to extend IIIF to support _audio_ and _video_ resources (see [A/V WG](http://iiif.io/community/groups/av/)). It is anticipated that the Presentation API will be extended to support image, audio and video rather than creating separate structures for relating and describing the presentation of audio and video.

## Community Focused

> The IIIF is driven by a community of research, national and state libraries, museums, companies and image repositories committed to providing access to high quality image resources.

  * Open, transparent and welcoming community
  * Primary communication channel is [iiif-discuss](http://iiif.io/community/#how-to-get-involved) mailing list
  * A number of [working and interest groups](http://iiif.io/community/groups/)
  * All [specifications open and CC-BY licensed](http://iiif.io//api/annex/notes/disclaimer/)
  * The IIIF Consortium (IIIF-C) is a membership organization that provides _"ongoing oversight for the development of IIIF technologies and managing the growth of the community"_. Participation in IIIF activities is not limited to member organizations or individuals.

## Tools and Implementations

> The IIIF specifications are supported by a number of non-commencial and commercial clients and servers.
